The vision to Replicate Jesus begins with understanding the three distinct directions we see Jesus moving during his life on earth:  UP, IN, & OUT.  UP is about his relationship with the Father.  IN is his investment in the disciples.  OUT is his pursuit of the lost.  In an effort to help us all go UP, IN & OUT utilize the practices in each section. But remember it’s in the overlap of these three directions that we experience the fullness of Christ.
