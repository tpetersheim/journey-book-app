    "how": `<p>Read Psalm 63:1-5.  Now after reading these words, restate them to God as if you are writing them yourself and saying them to your heavenly Father who you are believing loves you.</p>
    <p><i>“O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you;  my soul thirsts for you my body longs for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water…because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.  I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.”</i></p>
    <p>This may seem like it isn’t so difficult because David, the person who wrote this psalm, was talking to God, so the words relate well.  Try another passage that may be a bit more difficult:</p>
    <p>II Corinthians 4:8-9.  As you read this scripture, think about when you have felt like you have no friends, like you have been left alone and have a huge decision to make.  Now think about that God is a person sitting right with you, caring about how you are feeling.  Can you then  thank him using some of these word pictures?</p>
    <p><i>“Please, God, help me to know you surround me, that even though I feel pressure, I know that you will protect me.  I will not be destroyed!   I thank you, that I am made in your image, and you are the power that keeps me moving forward when I feel in despair, persecuted, struck down.  I will not be in despair.  Thank you, God!”</i></p>

God wants to hear from us.  He wants us to bring our joys, hardships, requests, and praise to Him, continually. The Bible tells us, <i>“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.” Philippians 4:6</i></p>
    <p>How many times do you sit down to pray and your mind wanders?  Do you forget to pray? Do you not feel like your prayers are being heard?  I think that we all go through times in life like this.  Prayer journaling may be a way to help.</p>`,

    Sometimes it is hard to be happy with our place in life.  “If I had a little more money I would be happy.” “If my job was different I would be happy.” “When I have accomplished ____, THEN my life will be complete.” How can we be content with our life, right now?<br>

Matthew 4 gives us the example of Jesus fasting for 40 days before he was tempted by Satan and began his ministry.</p>",
    "how": "<p>Pick a time period to not eat for. If you have never fasted before, a day is plenty long to start with. Try to pick a time that you can give some extra space to listening to God and prayer.

It reminds us of Jesus' suffering and our call to follow him into that (I Peter 2:21-23) and allows us to practice choosing God's glory over our own comfort (Ex 20:3-6; Mt 4:10).</p>
    <p>It involves sacrifice (Hebrews 13:15; I Peter 2:5; Romans 12:1), not giving thought to our reputation or what we look like to others (II Samuel 6:12-2). The uncomfortable feeling arises when something we hold very dear (what people think of us, social standing, anonymity, etc) is perceived to be threatened.

    <li>Attend other churches (worship with different believers in different ways.

    God gave us creative minds to glorify him and one of those ways that we can worship Him is through music.  We connect to God through music in a different way, drawing near to Him with emotion and reflection.  </p>`,
    "how": `<p>There are several ways that you can connect with God through music, all week long!
      <ul>
        <li>Listen to uplifting music in the car.</li>

        <li>Listen and discuss a song with your small group.</li>
      </ul>

    "what": `<p>God is waiting to speak to us through his creation when we take the time to put ourselves out in the middle of it. As Psalm 19:1 says, <i>“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.”</i></p>`,
    "how": `<p>Begin with observation.<br>
    The way the fallen leaves and logs break down to provide food for plants around; often with help from insects that we may think undesirable.<br>
    Shelter that is provided for God’s creatures.<br>
    Tiny flowers and elegant leaves that one has to look closely to see.<br>
    The beauty of the sunlight reflecting off the dew, or filtering through the trees.<br>
    These observations help us recognize the work of an infinitely intelligent God who is not only creative, but strategic;   a redemptive God who can take what seems negative; fallen limbs, trees, and leaves, and turn it into something that provides life, shelter, and nourishment;   a God who loves us immensely and provides beauty generously.  Some of that beauty is subtle so we are rewarded when we slow down enough to appreciate its intricacy.<br>

    <p>One way to hear God's voice is through a two-way conversation on paper.  The goal of this process is to deepen your relationship; not to get your "why's" answered, or to know the future, but hear Him speak words of edification, exhortation and comfort to you. <i>I Corinthians 14:3</i></p>`,
    "how": `<p>4 Keys to Hearing God's Voice.
      <ol>
        <li>Stillness.  Get alone and quiet your soul.  Play soft music, imagine yourself in nature, sing a love song to Jesus; whatever works for you. <i>Psalm 46:10a</i></li>
        <li>Vision.  Fix your eyes on Jesus.  Picturing Him in a familiar Bible scene may help you "see" Him. <i>Hebrews 12:2</i></li>
        <li>Tune to the flow of Holy Spirit. <i>John 7:37-39</i>.  See what He wants to tell you and show you.</li>
        <li>Journal.  Write your question.  Sample:  "What do you want to tell me today?"  Then write what you hear or see.  Test it later.</li>
      </ol>

    1 Corinthians 12:4-11.  He gives gifts and abilities and empowers as He chooses. </p>
    <p>Do you allow Him to teach you?<br>
    John 14:26 AMP.  He is your Teacher<br>
    I Corinthians 2:10-16.  He gives revelation, wisdom and understanding.</p>
    <p>Do you hear His Voice?<br>
    John 16:13.  Listen.  He will guide you into all truth.</p>
    <p>Are you continually being filled?<br>
    Ephesians 5:18b.  In the original Greek, "be filled" means "keep on being filled constantly and continually."</p>
    <p>How does that happen?<br>

    "how": `<p>Find at least an hour (more time is great!) to be quiet. Turn off or get away from all electronics and notifications (Alarms work with a phone on airplane mode!). Bring your Bible, something to write in and be still. As thoughts come to your mind that seem distracting, write them down and continue to sit in stillness. We don’t want to empty ourselves of everything, but rather to fill ourselves with Jesus. So as you find a place of stillness, begin to pray or read a passage of Scripture all the while asking God what he is speaking to you in your solitude.</p>

    <p>When we have sin in our lives, we often want to avoid God, fearing He will be angry.  But God is not human. While humans often want revenge, God’s desire is to restore our relationship with Him and for us be free of the burden. He already knows our action and is longing for us to agree with Him about sin and help us resist it.</p>
    <p><i>Jesus kept saying, “Father, forgive them, because they don’t know what they’re doing.” Luke 23:34</i></p>
    <p>How do I forgive others when they hurt me? It helps to understand that often people who hurt, are acting out of the pain they have experienced; pain that breaks God’s heart.  God doesn’t want any one created in His image to live a life of pain and hurt, that was never His plan for anyone.</p>`,
    "how": `<p>Offering grace to yourself: Ask God for the desire to change. Consider sharing with a trusted friend what sin you are confessing and ask them to pray for you.</p>

    <p><b>Pre-party</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Do clean the house.</li>
      <li>Don’t leave the TV on.</li>
      <li>Do have soft music on (refrain from playing Christian music).</li>
      <li>Do have candles lit.</li>
      <li>Prep your kids for what’s about to happen. Employ their help in hosting.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p><b>As people arrive</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Turn the porch light on!</li>
      <li>Invite a few outgoing guests to come early to be door greeters.</li>
      <li>Have drinks & finger foods out. Inviting guests to eat as they arrive reduces awkwardness.</li>
      <li>Introduce guests to other guests.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>To pray or not to pray? Know your audience. Some will feel like you are trying to trick them. 
    Offer a warm welcome and a toast. Give directions about the food. Keep the mood light.</p>
    <p><b>Party variations</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Happy Hour – a few simple finger foods and a drink depending on the season</li>
      <li>Outdoor gathering around a fire.</li>
      <li>Potluck – everyone brings a dish.</li>
      <li>Dinner Club – 3-6 couples take turns hosting monthly dinners for a year. No kids!</li>
      <li>Brai – all day gathering of friends for brunch and grill out.</li>
    </ul></p>

    "what": `<p>Being a missionary!  We are called to make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:19). A big part of making disciples, and our own faith journey, is the process of becoming more aware of the people and needs around us.  It takes intentionality of learning about ourselves, the culture that we are in, and creating relationships.</p>`,
    "how": `<p>Listen - Spend time in prayer.  Ask for the Holy Spirit to open your eyes and ears throughout the day as you interact with friends, coworkers, and neighbors.</p>
    <p>Follow - Get to know your neighbors and coworkers.  Engage people in conversation and learn. Learn about their work, hobbies, family, and history.  As relationships grow, follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit to know how to love those around you.  Be aware of the people and needs that God brings to you.</p>
    <p>Act - Invite neighbors over for dinner, or take them a meal when they’re sick.  Join the Care Portal to help with needs in the community.  Participate in community events and make connections with those around you.</p>`
