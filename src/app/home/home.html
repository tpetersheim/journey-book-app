    <h3>Replicate Jesus</h3>
    <p>
      The vision to Replicate Jesus begins with understanding the three distinct directions we see Jesus moving during his life
      on earth: UP, IN, & OUT. UP is about his relationship with the Father. IN is his investment in the disciples. OUT is
      his pursuit of the lost. In an effort to help us all go UP, IN & OUT utilize the practices in each section. But remember
      itâ€™s in the overlap of these three directions that we experience the fullness of Christ.
