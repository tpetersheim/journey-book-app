        <h3>Replicate Jesus</h3>
        <p>
            The vision to Replicate Jesus begins with understanding the three distinct directions we see Jesus moving
            during his life
            on earth: UP, IN, & OUT. UP is about his relationship with the Father. IN is his investment in the
            disciples. OUT is
            his pursuit of the lost. In an effort to help us all go UP, IN & OUT utilize the practices in each section.
            But remember
            itâ€™s in the overlap of these three directions that we experience the fullness of Christ.
