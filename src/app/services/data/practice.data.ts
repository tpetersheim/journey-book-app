    'what': '<p>Is it hard for you to focus on a scripture sometimes, or is it hard to put yourself in the story of God that you find yourself reading?  This is a common struggle, and praying scriptures can be a helpful way to work through it.</p>',
    'how': `<p>Read Psalm 63:1-5.  Now after reading these words, restate them to God as if you are writing them yourself and saying them to your heavenly Father who you are believing loves you.</p>
    <p><i>“O God, you are my God, earnestly I seek you;  my soul thirsts for you my body longs for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water…because your love is better than life, my lips will glorify you.  I will praise you as long as I live, and in your name I will lift up my hands.”</i></p>
    <p>This may seem like it isn’t so difficult because David, the person who wrote this psalm, was talking to God, so the words relate well.  Try another passage that may be a bit more difficult:</p>
    <p>II Corinthians 4:8-9.  As you read this scripture, think about when you have felt like you have no friends, like you have been left alone and have a huge decision to make.  Now think about that God is a person sitting right with you, caring about how you are feeling.  Can you then  thank him using some of these word pictures?</p>
    <p><i>“Please, God, help me to know you surround me, that even though I feel pressure, I know that you will protect me.  I will not be destroyed!   I thank you, that I am made in your image, and you are the power that keeps me moving forward when I feel in despair, persecuted, struck down.  I will not be in despair.  Thank you, God!”</i></p>

God wants to hear from us.  He wants us to bring our joys, hardships, requests, and praise to Him, continually. The Bible tells us, <i>“Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.” Philippians 4:6</i></p>
    <p>How many times do you sit down to pray and your mind wanders?  Do you forget to pray? Do you not feel like your prayers are being heard?  I think that we all go through times in life like this.  Prayer journaling may be a way to help.</p>`,
    'how': `<p>We are busy and distracted.  Slowing down to write out our prayers allows us to focus, slow down and be “hands on.”<br>
    Our journal can be a physical reminder to us to take time every day for God.<br>
    We can look back and reflect on how God has been faithful to us in our petitions.  How do I get started?<br>
    Find a journal and go for it!  Here’s an acronym that can help guide your prayers<br>
    Praise God<br>
    Repent of Sin<br>
    Ask for Others & Yourself<br>

    Life does not always go as we would like.  How do we remain grateful in the midst of trial and suffering –both large and small?<br>
    Sometimes it is hard to be happy with our place in life.  “If I had a little more money I would be happy.” “If my job was different I would be happy.” “When I have accomplished ____, THEN my life will be complete.” How can we be content with our life, right now?<br>

Fasting is an act of sacrifice that allows us to declare that we want to know and hear from God more than we want food! Matthew 4 gives us the example of Jesus fasting for 40 days before he was tempted by Satan and began his ministry.</p>',
    'how': `<p>Pick a time period to not eat for. If you have never fasted before, a day is plenty long to start with. Try to pick a time that you can give some extra space to listening to God and prayer. It is wonderful to fast with a small group of people, but the Bible tells us not to go around telling everyone about our fast so that we look extra good.  As you fast, write down the things you are experiencing and hearing from God.</p>
    <p>Some other ways you could fast:
      <ul>
        <li>Give up something that you rely on for comfort- Coffee, Chocolate, cheese, etc. for a week and focus your prayer life when you think about it.</li>
        <li>Fast from Technology or Social media for a period of time and use that time for spiritual growth</li>

    'what': `<p>Challenging ourselves to worship uncomfortably is a willful act of humility & submission (James 4:6-10). It reminds us of Jesus' suffering and our call to follow him into that (I Peter 2:21-23) and allows us to practice choosing God's glory over our own comfort (Ex 20:3-6; Mt 4:10).</p>
    <p>It involves sacrifice (Hebrews 13:15; I Peter 2:5; Romans 12:1), not giving thought to our reputation or what we look like to others (II Samuel 6:12-2). The uncomfortable feeling arises when something we hold very dear (what people think of us, social standing, anonymity, etc) is perceived to be threatened. The question is:  Will we choose to honor God or bow down to ourselves?</p>`,
    'how': `<p><ul>
      <li>On our knees/faces (psalm 95:6; rev 19:4)</li>

    'what': `<p>God is waiting to speak to us through his creation when we take the time to put ourselves out in the middle of it. As Psalm 19:1 says, <i>“The heavens declare the glory of God; the skies proclaim the work of his hands.”</i></p>`,
    'how': `<p>Begin with observation.<br>
    The way the fallen leaves and logs break down to provide food for plants around; often with help from insects that we may think undesirable.<br>
    Shelter that is provided for God’s creatures.<br>
    Tiny flowers and elegant leaves that one has to look closely to see.<br>
    The beauty of the sunlight reflecting off the dew, or filtering through the trees.<br>
    These observations help us recognize the work of an infinitely intelligent God who is not only creative, but strategic;   a redemptive God who can take what seems negative; fallen limbs, trees, and leaves, and turn it into something that provides life, shelter, and nourishment;   a God who loves us immensely and provides beauty generously.  Some of that beauty is subtle so we are rewarded when we slow down enough to appreciate its intricacy.<br>

    <p>There are many Greek words in the New Testament that mean save, heal or deliver but Sozo includes all three.  Sozo means spiritual, physical and emotional wellness; wholeness in body, soul and spirit.</p>

    'how': `<p>Sozo's aim is to increase your ability to hear God's voice and introduce you to the truth of who He is and who you really are; to heal hurts and remove hindrances that prevent you from walking in victory.</p>

    'how': `<p>4 Keys to Hearing God's Voice.
      <ol>
        <li>Stillness.  Get alone and quiet your soul.  Play soft music, imagine yourself in nature, sing a love song to Jesus; whatever works for you. <i>Psalm 46:10a</i></li>
        <li>Vision.  Fix your eyes on Jesus.  Picturing Him in a familiar Bible scene may help you "see" Him. <i>Hebrews 12:2</i></li>
        <li>Tune to the flow of Holy Spirit. <i>John 7:37-39</i>.  See what He wants to tell you and show you.</li>
        <li>Journal.  Write your question.  Sample:  "What do you want to tell me today?"  Then write what you hear or see.  Test it later.</li>
      </ol>

    John 3:5-7, I John 2:20 AMP</p>

    John 14:16-17 AMP.  He is your Helper, Comforter, Advocate, Intercessor, Counselor, Strengthener, Standby, to be with you forever.<br>
    1 Corinthians 12:4-11.  He gives gifts and abilities and empowers as He chooses. </p>
    <p>Do you allow Him to teach you?<br>
    John 14:26 AMP.  He is your Teacher<br>
    I Corinthians 2:10-16.  He gives revelation, wisdom and understanding.</p>
    <p>Do you hear His Voice?<br>
    John 16:13.  Listen.  He will guide you into all truth.</p>
    <p>Are you continually being filled?<br>
    Ephesians 5:18b.  In the original Greek, "be filled" means "keep on being filled constantly and continually."</p>

    'how': `<p>Read through the Lord’s Prayer from Matthew 6:5-14:<br>
    “And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full. But when you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father, who is unseen. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you. And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words. Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.<br>
    “This, then, is how you should pray:<br>
    ‘Our Father in heaven,<br>
    hallowed be your name,<br>
     your kingdom come,<br>
    your will be done,<br>
      on earth as it is in heaven.<br>
    Give us today our daily bread.<br>

      as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br>
    And lead us not into temptation,[a]<br>
      but deliver us from the evil one.[b]’<br>

    <p>When we have sin in our lives, we often want to avoid God, fearing He will be angry.  But God is not human. While humans often want revenge, God’s desire is to restore our relationship with Him and for us be free of the burden. He already knows our action and is longing for us to agree with Him about sin and help us resist it.</p>
    <p><i>Jesus kept saying, “Father, forgive them, because they don’t know what they’re doing.” Luke 23:34</i></p>
    <p>How do I forgive others when they hurt me? It helps to understand that often people who hurt, are acting out of the pain they have experienced; pain that breaks God’s heart.  God doesn’t want any one created in His image to live a life of pain and hurt, that was never His plan for anyone.</p>`,
    'how': `<p>Offering grace to yourself: Ask God for the desire to change. Consider sharing with a trusted friend what sin you are confessing and ask them to pray for you.</p>

    'how': `<p>There are lots of ways to give everyone the opportunity to tell their story. You can give each person a whole night and as long as they want to share, or give people a set time limit. The goal is to get to know each other and how you have all ended up where you are in life right now. Always make sure to give space for questions and close by spending time praying over whoever has shared.</p>`

    'title': 'Anointing',
    'what': `<p>Anointing is a Biblical symbol of God being with people. The Bible says we are anointed by God (1 Cor 1:21-22) and that we can anoint people who are sick to be healed (Jam 5:14). Chief Priests were anointed with oil when they moved into that role (Ex 29:7). Today, anointing someone with oil is a powerful symbol of God’s intention to work in and through us.</p>`,
    'how': `<p>As someone shares a place they are experiencing a hard circumstance or challenge, they may want or be open to receiving an anointing. With some oil (any kind will work!), make the symbol of the cross on the person’s forehead while praying for them. The prayer doesn’t need to be complex, but pray that they would have strength and the Spirit’s guidance/healing/wisdom in whatever they are facing.</p>`

    'how': `<p>Pray each morning that God will bring people across your path for whom you can be the incarnated Christ. Pray each morning that God will give you sensitivity to the Spirit as you encounter people. Reflect briefly at the end of the day; whom did God send to you? Did you meet them in the spirit of Jesus? How might you do better tomorrow?</p>`

    'what': `<p>1 Peter 3:15 tells us to, <i>“Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have.”</i>  As we learn to follow Jesus, we need to think about how to tell others about Jesus.</p>
<p>Gospel means good news and how we talk about the good news matters! Bruxy Cavey talks about the gospel in 1, 3, and 30 words:<br>
1 Word: Jesus<br>
3 Words: Jesus is Lord<br>
30 Words: The Gospel is the Good News that God has come to us through Christ to show His Love save us from sin share His life and to shut down religion</p>`,
    'how': `<p>Practice talking about what the good news of Jesus means in your life with a Christian friend or your missional community. What does it mean for you that Jesus shows us God’s love? That he saves us from sin? That he shares his life with us? That he has shut down religion? What does it mean that Jesus is Lord?</p>`

    <p>Follow - Get to know your neighbors and coworkers.  Engage people in conversation and learn. Learn about their work, hobbies, family, and history.  As relationships grow, follow the guidance of the Holy Spirit to know how to love those around you.  Be aware of the people and needs that God brings to you.</p>

    'title': 'Blessing in Secret',
    'what': `<p>In Matthew 6:1-4, Jesus describes the discipline of giving to the poor. There is an expectation of secrecy or at very least not self-promotion:<br>
    “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.”<br>
    “So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others. Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.  But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving may be in secret. Then your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.”<br>

      <li>Try sending money to someone without signing in the card or note.</li>

Most of us can’t operate that way and need to simplify how we try to care for the world around us. This is a practice to help bring focus to the place and person God is calling us to love intentionally.</p>`,
    'how': `<p>Start praying about the place God is calling you to. It could be your workplace, your neighborhood, a local school, or anywhere you have relationships and can spend time regularly. As God makes the place clear to you, begin to ask God for the one person you should be reaching out to. As you begin to hear who that person is, share it with a few people you trust so they also can begin praying for you and that person.</p>`
